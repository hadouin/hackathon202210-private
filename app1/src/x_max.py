# computing a list of max from a key/value input
# input :
#     * a filename to a file with the list of couple of letter(key) and an integer (value) as (a,3) separate by ';' # output 
#     * n number of max to return
# output :
#     the list key of the keys of the n max value as python list [a,f,3]
# the resolution must be done in less time than the naive implemented here on big files tests
# ____________
# command : max 
# args :
#   - pathfile 
#   - n
# n must be changed to 1 of negative or null
# the naive algorithm implemented
# run is the function called by the test runner
